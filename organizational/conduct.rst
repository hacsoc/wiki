Code of Conduct
===============

Hacker Society [#hacsoc]_ is, as Tim wrote in :doc:`hacsoc`, about an open
society:

  An open society promotes freedom of thought and expression, personal
  responsibility, individualism, cooperation, and equality of all citizens.

As such, we expect that our members behave in a way that allows us to achieve
this.  Participants in HacSoc events are expected to treat each other with
dignity and respect for each other's perspectives, experiences, and knowledge.
In particular, participants should recognize that people of all skill levels are
welcome, and should always be willing to help others learn.

We want Hacker Society to be a place where people can be comfortable regardless
of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability,
physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion.  As such, we do not
tolerate harassment.  This includes, but is not limited to:

- Rude or unwelcome comments about a person's gender, gender identity, gender
  expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, attire, race,
  age or religious expression.
- Sexual images in public spaces
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
- Harassing photography or recording
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events
- Inappropriate physical contact
- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

Necessarily, the goal of providing an open atmosphere for discussion and debate
has some tension with the goal of providing a welcoming environment.  We expect
that debate and constructive criticism are part of this open atmosphere.
However, when these discussions devolve into attacks against a person and/or
their intrinsic characteristics, we believe that this is unacceptable.

Enforcement
-----------

This policy applies at all Hacker Society events and spaces, online and
offline.  This includes, but is not limited to:

- Weekly talks
- Open hacks
- Link-State
- HackCWRU
- Mailing lists (hackers-discuss, cwru-hackers)
- GitHub organization
- Slack team

The policy applies to attendees as well as any speakers, sponsors, or other
participants in these activities and communication streams.  Although we don't
have any direct authority over behavior in our typical spaces such as the
Glennan Student Lounge, we expect that HacSoc participants will adhere to these
guidelines, and we also note that `Case's policies
<https://students.case.edu/handbook/policy/>`_ are always in force.

We expect participants asked to stop any harassing behavior to comply
immediately.  If participants do not comply, the Maintainer and HacSoc officers
retain the right to take any actions to keep HacSoc a welcoming environment for
all participants.  This includes warning the offender, or removing them from the
event or communication streams they are abusing.  This also includes further
measures, such as pursuing University action, should it become necessary.

Reporting
---------

If someone is making you feel unsafe or unwelcome at HacSoc, please report it as
soon as possible.  At events such as Link-State and HackCWRU, staff can be
identified by their shirts.  At other events, you can talk to the officers or
maintainer.  And you may always report harassing behavior to officers via email
(hacsoc-officers@case.edu) or via private message on Slack.

Other Policies
--------------

As mentioned above, the policies of the `CWRU Handbook
<https://students.case.edu/handbook/policy/>`_ are always applicable at HacSoc
events and in HacSoc gathering spaces.  Other policies that we believe apply
here are `ACM's
<http://www.acm.org/about-acm/acm-code-of-ethics-and-professional-conduct>`_ and
`IEEE's <http://www.ieee.org/about/ieee_code_of_conduct.pdf>`_, since HacSoc
represents chapters of both organizations.

.. [#hacsoc] In this code of conduct, we're using Hacker Society to refer to
             "everything" - the ACM and IEEE chapters as well as the talk series
             and mailing lists that are the backbone of our HacSoc community.
