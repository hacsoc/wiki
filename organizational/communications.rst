Hacker's Society Communication Streams
======================================

This is all about getting a set of written conventions for using our array of
communications methods within the Hacker Society. More complex services may
have their conventions broken out into another document so that this document
can have a fairly flat structure.

It is best to assume that other services shouldn’t be used for official group
communication, but this list of conventions does not serve as a whitelist for
allowed communication services. Improving the productivity of using a service
by changing the convention, or changing the service, is highly recommended.

Email
-----

- The most important of our communications.
- Contains several mailing lists:

    - `cwru-hackers mailing list
      <https://lists.case.edu/wws/info/cwru-hackers>`_
      For Hacker Society announcements. Emails are generally sent once per week
      (usually on Mondays) containing everything that is going on in Hacker
      Society. If you want to make an announcement, this is the list for
      you. Contact PR for getting your announcement in the weekly email.

      This list is moderated.
    - `hackers-discuss mailing list
      <https://lists.case.edu/wws/info/hackers-discuss>`_
      For discussion among members. If you have a question, or want to talk
      about your cool hack, this is the place.

      This list is not moderated. Any member should be able to start a
      discussion with Hacker Society via this thread. Please be respectful to
      the other subscribers, though, and think before posting.

      This list is not the place for announcements. If you want to make an
      announcement, you want cwru-hackers (see above).
    - `acm-downtime mailing list
      <https://lists.case.edu/wws/subscribe/acm-downtime>`_
      For announcements about server downtime. If you have a service running on
      our servers, you should be on this list.

      This list is moderated.
    - `hackers-summer mailing list
      <https://lists.case.edu/wws/info/hackers-summer>`_
      For discussion among Hacker Society members that are in the Cleveland
      area over the summer.

      This list is probably not moderated.
    - `acm-announce mailing list
      <https://lists.case.edu/wws/info/hackers-summer>`_
      A relic from an earlier time.
    - `acm-exec mailing list
      <https://lists.case.edu/wws/info/acm-exec>`_
      A relic from an earlier time.
    - `acm-members mailing list
      <https://lists.case.edu/wws/info/acm-members>`_
      A relic from an earlier time.
    - `acm-officers mailing list
      <https://lists.case.edu/wws/info/acm-officers>`_
      A relic from an earlier time.
    - `acm-talk mailing list
      <https://lists.case.edu/wws/info/acm-talk>`_
      A relic from an earlier time.

- Has to move over to some Google hosted service before the end of 2015?


GitHub
------
`Hacsoc Github Organization`_

.. _Hacsoc Github: https://github.com/hacsoc

- Always welcome new issue submissions, pull requests, code, and other
  contributions
- Have a different member approve and merge a Pull Request (when sensible)
- Has teams, which can be used for maintaining certain repositories
- Not all repositories are organization-related, some are student work.

Trello
------------------------
`Hacsoc Trello`_

.. _Hacsoc Trello: https://trello.com/hacsoc

Trello is our main platform for organizing events and other activities.  How you
should use Trello depends on what type of board you’re working on at the given
moment. If you are using it as an issue tracker for code see
:doc:`trello_for_projects`. Otherwise, there are several different layouts one
can use. For events a state based system *can* make sense. Try states like
``Todo``, ``In Progress``, and ``Completed``.  However, Trello is much more
flexible than such simple systems. See for example the `Hacsoc Talks
<https://trello.com/b/Pe68BIO7>`_ board. At the end of the day, do what works.

Slack
-----

Read more about it here: :doc:`slack`.

IRC
----------

.. _CWRU IRC: http://irc.case.edu

  Officers are encouraged to also maintain a presence here.
