How to Cater Food
========================

**Two Weeks Out:**

1.  Decide on location[s].  Oh hey.  :doc:`restaurant_catering_tips`

**Week and a Half Out:**

2.  Send out dietary restriction survey

3.  If order is over ~60 people, tell the location[s] you're planning on placing
    a large order

**Week Out:**

4.  Review their menu, and investigate catering procedure

5.  Peek at survey, and chalk up an order
  - round up when ordering for dietary restrictions -- better to be safe.

6.  Visit location, ask to speak with a manager about catering
  - have a number in mind, but do not finalize anything at this point
  - ask for an idea of the general distribution of food (portions of meats,
    etc.) -- they have a good idea on what people usually order, and what the
    average person wants
  - review payment options, phoning in with credit card information is common
  - discuss final order date, usually 2-3 days out
  - discuss what amenities are provided (napkins, plates, silverware, etc...)
  - depending on how payment is, you may want to let them know someone else
    will pay

**Half Week Out:**

7.  Finalize order
  - keep in mind the dietary restrictions
  - round up, but a perfect scenario involves running out of food at the end
  - possibly a good idea to run it past other members for blaring mistakes

8.  Place order
  - phone is common, but email provides assurance it's taken correctly

9.  Secure transportation: a car and a second person

**Day Of:**

10. Pick up
  - sign receipts, leaving a tip: 15% doesn't necessarily apply here, use best
    judgement.
  - SAVE THE RECEIPT, photograph it when you get a chance

11. Serve
  - place dietary restriction items on a different table, or at the end of the
    line
  - it would be helpful to add signs indicating what each food item is, and
    what each item contains
  - putting all the food out at once causes people to take more, keeping boxes
    under the table makes it last longer.

12. Clean up
  - don't leave a mess.
