Maintaining Hacker Society
===========================


The Mission of Hacker Society
-----------------------------

A time and place for people to learn about technology from each other, in
order to build a community, to empower the individual, promote equality, and
build an open society.

**Open Society**: An open society promotes freedom of thought and expression,
personal responsibility, individualism, cooperation, and equality of all
citizens.


Organizational Structure of Hacker Society
------------------------------------------

Hacker Society seeks to embody an open society. We have one servant in charge
of ensuring the weekly lecture series continues called the Maintainer. Through
our communication tools such as email lists other participants are encouraged
to hold their own events.

ACM and IEEE are more traditional student groups at CWRU. They have money and
hold LinkState and hackCWRU. In practice many of the officers of ACM and IEEE
are also Hacker Society participants.

If you would like to hold an event or a lecture outside of the weekly ones
organized by the maintainer here is how you do it. If you need money talk to
ACM/IEEE, the EECS department, and/or invite companies to sponsor the event.

1. Decide on a date and time.
2. Decide on a location. Kim Yurchick (in the EECS office) or ACM/IEEE officers
   can assist you in booking a room.
3. Announce the event on hackers-discuss@case.edu and ask the Maintainer to
   announce on cwru-hackers@case.edu
4. Do other forms of advertisements (such as flyers)
5. Send a reminder email day of.
6. Hold the event!

Some Event Ideas:

- A GPG public key signing party
- A Linux or BSD install fest
- A code golf competition
- A quine competition
- A hackathon
- A capture the flag game (where the flag is a file on a computer and the
  teams have to break into the computer to "grab" the flag)


Major Responsibilities of the Maintainer
----------------------------------------

Every Semester
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Send out an invite for people to give lectures. This should go out on the
  main list.
- If you know any good companies (through internships etc...) attempt to
  invite someone to give a talk.
- Consult friends and other members to recommendations on companies + contact
  information.
- Create a schedule of talks using the Trello board. Each talk should get a
  card and go in the Spring 2016 list.
- Make sure the room is reserved. We have been using Glennan 421 talk to Kim
  Yurchick to get it done.

Every Week
^^^^^^^^^^

- Make sure there is always a talk or other content each week. This means that
  you should have a backup talk that you yourself can give if everything falls
  through. Also know of other members (me for instance or Andrew Mason) who
  can be counted on to have a talk in a hurry.
- Make sure the announcement email is sent. This is sometimes done by the ACM
  PR person but it is ultimately the responsibility of the Maintainer to
  advertise the weekly talk.
- Make sure the speaker is good to go.
- Day of send a reminder email that the talk is happening. Remember to include
  where and when.
- Send email to the next week to confirm their talk.
- Send email to 2 weeks out to confirm their talk.

In general make sure at minimum of 3 weeks out is always scheduled if
possible. Especially at the beginning of the semester. It is ok if it falls
off at the end or during midterms. Things get busy and attendance drops a
little as well. The main job of the maintainer is to be organized. It is
really not too much work but it is consistent over the course of the semester.
You also can and should try and find ways to get people together after Hacker
Society lectures and to have other smaller events.


Rules for Hacker Society Lectures
---------------------------------

1. Hacker Society is not a general forum, lectures are expected to be of a
   scientific, technical or educational nature. The maintainer reserves to the
   right to reject any talk not fitting with the mission of Hacker Society or
   which is deemed to be in bad taste. Hacker Society is not a forum for hate
   speech or other such language.
2. Recruiting talks or "information sessions" are not allowed. All talks are
   expected to be technical.
3. Recruiting pitches are limited to one slide.
4. Lectures are expected to be conducted professionally.
5. If it is your first time giving a talk at Hacker Society, we will ask to 
   see your slides about two weeks in advance.
6. CWRU's policies on harassment are always in force on campus and at Hacker
   Society events.
