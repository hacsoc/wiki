Community Engagement
====================

CWRU has plenty of cool stuff going on, and HacSoc presents some awesome weekly
events (not to mention LinkState and HackCWRU).  So it's not like HacSoc members
should feel like they're lacking in community engagement.  But the fact is that
Cleveland has a surprisingly active tech scene, and every HacSoc member should
really consider participating in it as much as possible!  It'll end up
benefitting everyone:

- You'll learn plenty from really cool talks that are put on by Cleveland
  interest groups.  There are quite a few interest groups out there, so if you
  spend a little time looking, you probably can find one for your interests.
- You'll meet really cool people, many of whom do things like hiring at tech
  companies, who may just be interested in hiring a smart, self-motivated HacSoc
  member that comes to their tech meetups!
- The more HacSoc members head out to these tech meetups, the more our
  reputation and name spreads around the community.  That means, among other things:

  - More people and companies coming to us, interested in giving HacSoc talks.
  - HacSoc members become more valued in the eyes of companies who hear about us!

Here are some pointers for places to start getting involved with the Cleveland
Tech scene:

**Cleveland Tech Slack**

Join the Cleveland Tech Slack team!  You can sign up `here
<https://cleveland-tech.herokuapp.com/>`_, and once you have an account you can
join the conversation `here <https://cleveland-tech.slack.com>`_.  Be sure to
introduce yourself on the #intro channel, and join as many topic-specific
channels as you are interested in.  Watch out for announcements of meetups here.
But, this probably isn't the place to have notifications on for any activity, so
you'll have to peruse the messages every now and then.

**Cleveland Python Area Interest Group**

There is a `Cleveland Python Interest Group
<http://www.meetup.com/Cleveland-Area-Python-Interest-Group/>`_.  They have
meetups every so often at the LeanDog boat, complete with talks, beer, pizza,
and friendly tech conversation.  If you are at all interested in Python, it may
be worth signing up and getting the emails, so you can remember to make your way
out there for their meetups.

**Cleveland Big Data and Hadoop User Group (CHUG)**

Similarly, there is the Cleveland Big Data and Hadoop User Group (CHUG for
short).  They are also on `Meetup <http://www.meetup.com/Cleveland-Hadoop/>`_.

really awesome website that aggregates a lot of announcements for tech related
events, as well as links to even more resources for the CLE community.  Check it
