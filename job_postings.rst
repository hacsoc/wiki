Hacker Society Job Postings
===========================

If you have an opportunity for an internship, freelance work, or a full-time
position that you would like to make available to HacSoc members, we would be
happy to forward along the details to our mailing list. However, we do have a
few "house rules" regarding postings:

Be sure to mention the basics such as location, type of development or
research, and pay. Students are most interested in knowing who they'll be
working with, what they'll be doing, and what the company does. We ask that you
save business & funding details for private conversations if the topic
arises.

If you'd like assistance in writing a job post aimed towards students or if you
have other questions such as expected pay or hours, contact acmpr@case.edu.
We'd be happy to assist you so that your post gets the maximum response.

Inappropriate job postings will be deleted. While the final decision is at the
full discretion of the group admin, students are encouraged to report job
postings they find inappropriate.

Please be aware that many students may have strong opinions on NDAs.
