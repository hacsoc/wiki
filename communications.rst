Preamble (Feel free to skip this)

This is all about getting a set of written conventions for using our array of communications methods within the Hacker Society. More complex services may have their conventions broken out into another document so that this document can have a fairly flat structure. [...]

It is best to assume that other services shouldn’t be used for official group communication, but this list of conventions is intended neither to restrict nor to forbid use of any other service. Particularly for person-to-person contact, other services may serve people better and they should use those services. Improving the productivity/effect of using a service by changing the convention is highly recommended.

**Email**

- Old, somewhat clunky, and the most important of our communications.
- Contains several mailing lists:

    - `cwru-hackers mailing list <https://lists.case.edu/wws/info/cwru-hackers>`_
    - `hackers-discuss mailing list <https://lists.case.edu/wws/info/hackers-discuss>`_
    - `acm-downtime mailing list <https://lists.case.edu/wws/subscribe/acm-downtime>`_
    - `hackers-summer mailing list <https://lists.case.edu/wws/info/hackers-summer>`_
    - `acm-announce mailing list <https://lists.case.edu/wws/info/hackers-summer>`_
    - `acm-exec mailing list <https://lists.case.edu/wws/info/acm-exec>`_
    - `acm-members mailing list <https://lists.case.edu/wws/info/acm-members>`_
    - `acm-officers mailing list <https://lists.case.edu/wws/info/acm-officers>`_
    - `acm-talk mailing list <https://lists.case.edu/wws/info/acm-talk>`_

- Has to move over to some Google hosted service before the end of the year?


**GitHub:** `Hacsoc Github`_

.. _Hacsoc Github: https://github.com/hacsoc

- Always welcome new issue submissions, and Pull Requests
- Organization and project administration.

**Trello:** `Hacsoc Trello`_

.. _Hacsoc Trello: trello.com/hacsoc

- Lengthy, create a dedicated doc?
- Boards:

    - How you should use trello depends on what type of board you’re working on at the given moment.
    - Board for a Repository

        - Boy, you’re in luck. Someone wrote this great wiki page for how to use Trello as an issue tracker for a project. You can check it out `here <https://github.com/hacsoc/hack_cwru/wiki/Trello>`_ .
    - General Board/Board for an Event

        - Column-based movement from start to completion

- Multiplicity of admins

**Slack:** `Hacsoc Slack`_ 

.. _Hacsoc Slack: hacsoc.slack.com

- The place for low-latency communication. Everyone should have Slack easily accessible and should reasonably promptly receive push notifications for ``@`` notifications in ``#general`` and for direct messages.	
- Devices: mobile/desktop/web
- Channels: ``#general``, ``#random``, and topic-focused channels

	- Direct Messages
	- Label/color convention (code project boards vs other boards)
	- Integrating a channel with Trello

**IRC:** `CWRU IRC`_

.. _CWRU IRC: http://irc.case.edu 

- What Slack is copying and polishing.  Very basic and simple chatroom protocol.
- We’ve got irc.case.edu with ``#cwru``, ``#acm``, ``#hackers``, ``#ieee``
- Show up if you’re interested
- Consider setting up a ZNC bouncer to keep your nick connected basically all the time
