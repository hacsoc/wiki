HacSoc Blog Directory
=====================

Many of our HacSoc members maintain a web presence where they publish a blog.
We think that they're pretty great, so when you have free time, you should check
out their writing.  If you're particularly interested in keeping up with HacSoc
members' thoughts, you should find their RSS feeds and add them to your favorite
RSS reader (e.g. `Feedly <https://feedly.com>`_).

If you'd like to add your own blog link, feel free to submit a pull request to
the `repository for this wiki <https://github.com/hacsoc/wiki>`_.  Finally, if
you're interested in creating your own blog, you can probably talk to any of the
listed people below about how to go about it.
