Linux
=====

`Linux <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux>`_ is an `Operating System
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system>`_, like Windows or Mac OS X
[#fn-kernel]_. Unlike those operating systems, Linux is open source, and
completely free of charge. While you may expect something that costs no money
and is developed by a team of "volunteers"[#fn-vol]_ to be low quality, Linux
is actually very good.

If you follow through this subsection, you should be at the point where you have
installed Linux on your computer or a virtual machine. This is a prerequisite
for a number of things in the "Hacker's Toolbox."

HacSoc typically holds Linux install fests at the beginning of each year. These
are excellent times to get help on this stuff!

.. [#fn-kernel] Sort of... If you want to be *technical*, it's an operating
   system `kernel <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)>`_.
   This is a distinction you'll learn about in your Operating Systems class
   (EECS 338). For now, the distinction doesn't matter too much.
.. [#fn-vol] This is also not exactly true. While some Linux Kernel developers
   are unpaid volunteers, many are paid by big companies (even Microsoft and
   Apple) to contribute code.
